# WheelFlow 
WheelFlow is an **Android Application** that focuses on collecting and sharing geo-localized **accessibility information** about routes in order to assist **wheelchair users**. 
Users can search for a path from a source to a destination and receive accessibility information about the path.
<br>
The core of the application is the collection of vibration data based on crowdsourcing: route contributor users can collect data using their smartphone while they are on the move and share it with a web server responsible for classifying the data and handling the routing requests.<br>
**Machine Learning** techniques will enable the smart application to classify routes as accessible or not.

 ## Project Architecture
 The architecture is composed of a Python server and two Android Client applications.
 <ul>
  <li>The Python server stores the model used to classify the data, handles the interaction with the database, and answers the clientsâ€™ requests allowing users to ask for routing information taking into consideration the accessibility of the locations.</li>
  <li>A main Android application allows the user to get an overview of the accessibility barriers, contribute by collecting data in the city, and search for a route from a source to a destination.</li>
  <li>Another Android client application is fully dedicated to data collection.</li>
 </ul>

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- PythonServer/ contains the source code of a centralized Python server handling the crowdsourcing from many Android apps in a client-server fashion.
- DataCollection/ contains the Android source code of the application dedicated to the data collection.
- DataAnalysis/ contains the Python scripts used for analyzing the data and using different machine learning techniques.
- AndroidApplication/ contains the Android source code of the main Android application providing all the required features.
  
Each folder will contain a readMe file explaining more in detail each of the modules.
<br>A SQL file is also present for re-creating the structure of the database.
